        <p className="description">
          Over the last 12 years, Iâ€™ve also held roles as a Design Technologist, System Educator, and Data Visualization Lead.<br />
          I blend practical considerations with a natural inclination toward beauty and simplicity to create valuable, intuitive, and enjoyable products.<br />
          My most scaled project was at Google on the Nest smart home interfaces; Google holds more than 20% of the global smart speaker market and sold 50 million Google Home devices worldwide in 2021.<br />
          While digital craft holds the majority of my attention, I am also a committed husband, trained yoga instructor, and lifelong learner.<br />
          What fulfills me most is finding new, better ways to be and do things.<br />
